# Sit Anywhere!
Sit on stairs and slabs, in fact sit anywhere you'd like!

## üìñ Instructions:
To be able to sit on any surface that you want just look all the way down, quickly double tap sneak and then right-click! :D

To sit on a slab or on stairs, just stand on it and right click it. As simple as that.

## ü§î Why is this project better than the others?
- Because it's primarily a datapack, that means you just drop it on your map or server and anyone can use it without having to install anything!
- I've made sure that it's a datapack, or even a mod, so that it can be active on any world you create! For maximum flexibility. Want to use it on a specific world? Use the datapack. Want it on every world you join, without even needing to setup it? Use the mod!
- Versatile and non-intrusive: like many seating mods, you can use any staircase or slab to sit on. But you'll have to stand on it first! Because I've sat far too often by mistake without this feature. But you can also sit anywhere else! You're not limited to tiles or stairs. They just have a well-defined place to sit, which centers them well.
 - As this is a datapack and not a mod, it's less likely to be broken by future minecraft updates. Still possible but less likely.

## ‚§µÔ∏è Installation:
### Datapack:
Download the latest release and put the datapack  `.zip` file into the datapacks folder of your Minecraft world.
